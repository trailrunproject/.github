Glacier Point
======================
This is arguably one of the most magnificent views in all of the National Parks. It overlooks the high country with a birds-eye view of Yosemite Valley, Half Dome, Yosemite Falls, Nevada Fall and Vernal Fall.

From the Glacier Point parking area, take the short, paved, wheelchair-accessible path to the exhilarating and hair-raising lookout point, 3,214' above Half Dome Village, on the floor of Yosemite Valley. The views are expansive and truly breathtaking. From this vantage point, visitors will be able to take in splendid views of waterfalls and the icnoic granite features like Half Dome.

Short Walk: Glacier Point Road is typically open between late May or early June to sometime in November, weather dependent. From the Glacier Point parking area, take the short, paved, wheelchair-accessible path to the lookout.

From mid-May to September, you may be required to use a free shuttle from Badger Pass to Glacier Point between 10 am to 4:30 pm when the Glacier Point parking lot fills. This free shuttle leaves Badger Pass every 20 minutes.
